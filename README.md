# **CS386_FinalProject**

### This is a Code formatter for weekly projects in Leverington's CS136 and CS249 classes.

### TODO
* Fix bug causing too many indentations

* Add feature to count how many violations/points were saved

* Other ideas?

### About
Source code is found in CodeFormatter.c, the compiled exe file is also included

SetUtilitiesThree.c is the current test file, though the formatter should be able to handle any .c file no matter the prior formatting, as long as it doesn't have any compiling errors.

The recompiling folder is for making changes to the .exe file. More info is included in the readme for that folder.
